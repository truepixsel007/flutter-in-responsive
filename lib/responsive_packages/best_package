🔍 1. flutter_screenutil
✅ Best For:
   Mobile-first apps (e.g., e-commerce, fitness, news)
   Pixel-perfect UI based on a specific design size (e.g., Figma frame 375×812)
💡 Features:
   Responsive width (.w), height (.h), and font size (.sp)
   Easy to convert static design into responsive layout
   Supports r (radius), padding, margin, etc.
🚫 Weaknesses:
   Doesn't support breakpoints (e.g., desktop/tablet-specific layouts)
   Better for mobile, not for Flutter web or large screen devices

🔍 2. responsive_framework
✅ Best For:
   Multi-platform apps (mobile + tablet + web)
   Projects that require breakpoint-based layouts (like Bootstrap)
💡 Features:
  Define custom breakpoints (MOBILE, TABLET, DESKTOP)
  Auto-scales UI components at different screen sizes
  Supports layout switching (row vs column) based on screen width
🚫 Weaknesses:
  Slightly more boilerplate
  Doesn't support per-element scaling like .sp, .w, etc.

🔍 3. sizer
✅ Best For:
   Simple responsive layouts (mobile/tablet)
  Using percentages of screen width and height (80.w, 20.h, etc.)
💡 Features:
  Very easy to use
 Supports sp, w, h similar to flutter_screenutil
🚫 Weaknesses:
   Not very flexible for complex layouts or web breakpoints
   Less customizable than flutter_screenutil

   | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Mobile-first apps (fitness, e-commerce)  | ✅ `flutter_screenutil`   |
   | Multi-platform (web/tablet/desktop)      | ✅ `responsive_framework` |
   | Simple apps, quick responsiveness needed | ✅ `sizer`                |


 🎯 Final Recommendation:
 If you're working on mobile-first Flutter apps (which most apps are), go with:
 ✅ flutter_screenutil
 Most balanced
 Granular control
 Matches Figma/XD designs accurately
 But if you plan to scale to web or tablets later, combine it with layout strategies like LayoutBuilder or consider responsive_framework.
